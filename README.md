Hello World. There is already code in here because I used github pages for my old portfolio.

A little bit about me. Im a senior at CSI, about to graduate in May. Im trying to specialize in backend development. My hobbies include playing video games, watching youtube, working out and playing basketball. My goal for this semester is to try and land an internship or a new grad role.
